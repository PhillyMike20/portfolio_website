              While pursuing an MA in English, I participated in a National
              Endowment for the Humanities-funded Digital Humanities project.
              The project, called <a href="http://lookingforwhitman.org/" target="_blank">"Looking for Whitman"</a >
              was an online community centered on the life and work of the American poet Walt Whitman. Students chose a niche of study
              related to Whitman and completed individualized assignments to
              showcase on their page where others could see and comment on them.
              This experience had a profound impact on me, and opened my mind to
              new possibilities in education. I left "Looking for Whitman"
              wanting more, and my career and education choices since then have
              been guided by a desire to create similar experiences for others.

                For several semesters, Michael Stirm taught Writing Skills II and III in the Developmental Writing Department at Camden County College. With a demeanor reflecting his equally professional and personable nature, he engaged his students within a collegiate discourse to which they responded readily. Michael successfully multi-tasked within a structured department that required faculty members to adhere to strict and nuanced guidelines for curricular content and assessment, demonstrating his ability to stay organized, learn quickly, and handle administrative responsibility. While he abided by the curricular requirements, though, he willingly extended his efforts beyond those prescribed to create an enjoyable learning experience, particularly through his experimentation with technology and incorporation of additional literature. Per our requirement of all adjuncts, Michael participated in the Portfolio Assessment and Mentoring Program, for which the department won an Honorable Mention in the Two-Year College English Association’s 2010 Diana Hacker Awards for Outstanding Programs in English. Using a holistic approach to portfolio assessment and taking advantage of one-on-one training sessions led by seasoned faculty, he adopted portfolios as a hailed "best practice" in English pedagogy and gleaned the benefits of individualized colleague-based training that equips him to work with students as an English instructor, as he knows the requirements of good writing and the expectations of English departments. More importantly, throughout his employment, often while juggling several sections of writing, Michael successfully completed his graduate studies in English where he honed his writing and research skills. Having achieved mastery of language and of literary analysis, Michael is qualified to instruct students in research and writing.

                Michael’s superior writing skills, experience in the classroom and technology skill set have been applicable and invaluable to several critical academic support functions. He is the consummate “team player” and displays a friendly, but professional manner at all times. I have received many written and oral commendations for Michael’s service to the college community, and I can offer my recommendation without reservation whatsoever.

                Michael provided students with excellent writing instruction with a warm and friendly demeanor. His patience and eagerness to educate and inform helped students expand their knowledge and gain a better understanding of the writing process. Michael's exceptional writing abilities make him a preferred choice in any realm of literacy instruction.

                I first worked with Michael when he chaired the Programming Committee of the Atlantic County Library System. His skill in keeping the meetings focused was impressive, and he brought new ideas to the table at each session. He was eager to share knowledge he gained either in school or from his own experiences with designing successful library programs. I was most impressed by his thinking "outside the box" when it came to memorable library programming on a budget.
                His passion for community engagement with the library is extraordinary, and he was known for tailoring programs specific to each branch and their individual communities. He never hesitated to play to the strengths of those he worked with; thereby creating a team environment that is vital in the library community. Much of what I use today in designing my own programs and working with my library community, I learned from Michael..
